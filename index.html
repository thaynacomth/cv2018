                  <h5><u> A little bit about me...</u></h5>
                  <p>I was in Brazil studying Law and I decided to move to Melbourne to learn English. When I arrived I was looking for some online courses to practice the language on Udemy, there I found lots of online courses and I just loved it.</p>
                  <p>When I was almost finishing my English course, I had to decided if I was going to extend my visa or not, as I loved this amazing country, I decided to keep livinig here! To do this, I had to choose another course after English. I tought that I should study something that I could use in Brazil too. Information Technology was a good option to do this. When I was researching about this amazing area, I found lots of things but when I found Web Development was a love at first sight..</p>
                  <p>I did not have a computer when I started to study web development, I used applications to practice on the cell phone. Because of this, I always pay attention if the site is responsive or not and I consider this very important.</p>
                  <p>My first course was Python, after this I did some HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript basic courses, later I started Bootstrap4, Wordpress and today I am doing <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/v4/content" target="_blank"><em>The Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp</em></a> and I am learning a lot. </p>  

                  <h5><u>My Experience in Australia...</u></h5>
                  <p>When I finished some online courses and I praticced <a href="https://github.com/thaynacomth?tab=repositories">developing</a> web sites from my mind, I decided to apply for an internship to have some experience in an aussie company, I am lucky I got a job at 121 Group, there I alearned and praccticed all my WordPress skills.</p>
                  <p>I am improving my knowledge developing some web sites, for exemple: <a href="http://rec2rec.nerdster.us/">TailorMadeRec2Rec</a> and <a href="http://scaffold.nerdster.com.au/">BT Scaffolds</a> and I am having an Agency experience, how exciting is it and of course, seen how is the life of a Web Developer (with lots of bugs, but amazing when we fix it!).</p>
                  <p>I would love to practice even more all things that I am learning daily in your company, doing my best, working in group and learning as much as possible to help you.</p>
